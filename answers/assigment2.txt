KEITH DEVLIN: Introduction to Mathematical Thinking                    ASSIGNMENT 2 (for Lecture 2)

## The Answers with the check symbol ✓ are my answers. The answers without the ✓ are because I didn't know how to solve
and saw on the video :). What i'm calling the rightAnswer is the answer of the Keith Devlin at the video :)


  1. Simplify the following symbolic statements as much as you can, leaving your answer in the standard
     symbolic form. (In case you are not familiar with the notation, I’ll answer the first one for you.)
     
     (a) (π > 0) ∧ (π < 10) [Answer: 0 < π < 10.] 
     (b) (p ≥ 7) ∧ (p < 12) [Answer: 7 ≤ p < 12.] ✓
     (c) (x > 5) ∧ (x < 7)  [Answer: 5 < x < 7 .] ✓
     (d) (x < 4) ∧ (x < 6)  [Answer: x < 4 .] ✓
     (e) (y < 4) ∧ (y² < 9) [Answer: y < 4 ^ |y| < 3.] or [Answer: y < 3] ?? is this true? ... 
     							No, wrong  -> [rightAnswer: [-3 < y < 3]  
     (f) (x ≥ 0) ∧ (x ≤ 0)  [Answer: x = 0] ✓
     
  2. Express each of your simplified statements from question 1 in natural English.
  
  	A:
  	  (a) π is greater than 0 and less than 10.
  	  (b) p is greater or equal to 7 and less than 12.
  	  (c) x is greater than 5 and less than 7.
  	  (d) x is less than 4.
  	  (e) y is greater than -3 and less than 3.
  	  (f) x is equal to 0
    
  3. What strategy would you adopt to show that the conjunction φ1 ∧ φ2 ∧ . . . ∧ φn is true?
  
 	 A: I need to analyses the composition of those statements, if all of them are true so the conjunction is
 	 true. 
  
  4. What strategy would you adopt to show that the conjunction φ1 ∧ φ2 ∧ . . . ∧ φn is false?
  
  	A: If any of theses statements are false so false is the conjunction.
  
  5. Simplify the following symbolic statements as much as you can, leaving your answer in a standard
     symbolic form (assuming you are familiar with the notation):

      (a) (π > 3) ∨ (π > 10)  [Answer: π > 3] ✓
      (b) (x < 0) ∨ (x > 0)   [Answer: x ≠ 0] ✓
      (c) (x = 0) ∨ (x > 0)   [Answer: x ≥ 0]
      (d) (x > 0) ∨ (x ≥ 0)   [Answer: x ≥ 0] ✓
      (e) (x > 3) ∨ (x² > 9)  [Answer: x > 3] -> [rightAnswer: (x > 3) v (x < -3)]     
      
  6. Express each of your simplified statements from question 5 in natural English.
  	
  	A:
  	  (a) pi is greater than 3.
  	  (b) x is different to 0.
  	  (c) x is equal or greater than 0.
  	  (d) x is equal or greater than 0.
  	  (e) x is greater than 3 or x is less than -3.
  
  7. What strategy would you adopt to show that the disjunction φ1 ∨ φ2 ∨ . . . ∨ φn is true?
  
  	A: I would check if there is at least one true statement.
  
  8. What strategy would you adopt to show that the disjunction φ1 ∨ φ2 ∨ . . . ∨ φn is false?
	
	A: I would check if all the statements are false.
	
  9. Simplify the following symbolic statements as much as you can, leaving your answer in a standard
     symbolic form (assuming you are familiar with the notation):
      (a) ¬(π > 3.2) [Answer: π < 3.2] -> [rightAnswer: π ≤ 3.2] 
      (b) ¬(x < 0)   [Answer: x ≥ 0] ✓
      (c) ¬(x² > 0)  [Answer: x = 0] ✓
      (d) ¬(x = 1)   [Answer: x ≠ 1] ✓
      (e) ¬¬ψ        [Answer: ψ] ✓
      
 10. Express each of your simplified statements from question 9 in natural English.
 
 	A:
 	  (a) π is less or equal to 3.2
 	  (b) x is greater or equal to 0
 	  (c) x is equal to zero
 	  (d) x is different than 1
 	  (e) ψ is true

 11. Let D be the statement “The dollar is strong”, Y the statement “The Yuan is strong” and T
     the statement “New US–China trade agreement signed”. Express the main content of each of the
     following (fictitious) newspaper headlines in logical notation. (Note that logical notation captures
     truth, but not the many nuances and inferences of natural language.) How would you justify and
     defend your answers?

      (a) Dollar and Yuan both strong 
      		[Answer: D ∧ Y ] ✓
      		
      (b) Yuan weak despite new trade agreement, but Dollar remains strong
      		[Answer: ¬Y ∧ T ∧ D ] 
      		
      (c) Dollar and Yuan can’t both be strong at same time.
		[Answer: ¬ D ∧ Y ]
		
     (d) New trade agreement does not prevent fall in Dollar and Yuan
     		[Answer: T ¬ D ∧ Y ] -> [rightAnswer: T ∧ ¬D ∧ ¬Y]
     		
     (e) US–China trade agreement fails but both currencies remain strong
     		[Answer: ¬T ∧ D ∧ Y]


TWO TO THINK ABOUT AND DISCUSS WITH OTHER STUDENTS

 1. In US law, a trial verdict of “Not guilty” is given when the prosecution fails to prove guilt. This, of
    course, does not mean the defendant is, as a matter of actual fact, innocent. Is this state of affairs
    captured accurately when we use “not” in the mathematical sense? (i.e., Do “Not guilty” and “¬
    guilty” mean the same?) What if we change the question to ask if “Not proven” and “¬ proven”
    mean the same?
    
	A:
	

 2. The truth table for ¬¬φ is clearly the same as that for φ itself, so the two expressions make identical
    truth assertions. This is not necessarily true for negation in everyday life. For example, you might
    find yourself saying “I was not displeased with the movie.” In terms of formal negation, this has
    the form ¬(¬ pleased), but your statement clearly does not mean that you were pleased with the
    movie. Indeed, it means something considerably less positive. How would you capture this kind of
    use of language in the formal framework we have been looking at?
	
	A:



                                                   2
